# part_3

This project is from MSc Software design with artificial intelligence subject Applied Scripting Languages 2020. The primary goal is to break up the data files with no libraries except for Matplotlib/Seaborn which is used for visualisation of the data. 

Important: In this part, you may only use the following Python Features
  
  • Section 1: Fundamentals (input, formatted output, basic string processing, calculations, the math module)
  
  • Section 2: Control Structures (if-elif-else, while and for)
  
  • Section 3: Data Structures 1 – Lists, Tuples and Sets, List Comprehensions
  
  • Section 4: File Processing and Exceptions
  
  • Section 5: Functions, Testing and Modular Design
  
  • Section 6: Data Structures 2 – Dictionaries, Maps, Dictionary Comprehensions
  
  • Section 7: Visualisation with Matplotlib/Seaborn.
  
Do not use, classes, the csv or statistics modules, pandas/NumPy or any other features.

Deliverables
  1. A third completed Student Plagiarism Disclaimer Form: printed, signed and uploaded.
  2. Details of any additional analysis (not already done in Part 2), the visualisation you performed and the results achieved. Include output screenshots along with appropriate descriptions. What conclusions can you come to based on your analysis and visualisation of the data?
  3. A detailed design of your program, using top-down modular design: include a design diagram (structure chart) and for each function describe its purpose, and its inputs and outputs.
  4. Your Python Program files (Using Python 3) and any associated files (e.g. data files). You should use Exception Handling wherever it is appropriate in your code.
  5. Python documentation for each module (file) and user-defined function in your program. Each module (file) should include a documentation string (docstring) describing its purpose and it should also include your Student ID. Each function should include a docstring describing its purpose, parameters and what it returns, if anything. Use pydoc to generate the documentation for each module and function.
  6. Detailed Unit Testing: include the test cases and the results in the report, and the test cases with the program code.
  7. A Reflective Learning Log which provides your reflections at this stage of the assignment.
  8. Detailed references to other sources used in this part of your assignment.
